// I think I preferred my approach from hw2
// I am following the assignment, so I broke up my hashmap of closures into functions
// but now there is a little more repetition and I am a bit confused about some things:
//              placement of eprinting the operation
//              multiple calls of env::args() (if main is only supposed to handle command arg)
//              Where exactly I was supposed to use the format! macro
//              I ended up not putting the ? operator after the modifying functions calls
//
// I am a little unhappy about the fact that some error get printed out inside an extra Err variant
//
// The error handling taught me new stuff though!
// I hope my build_error function isn't entirely mimo m√≠su
// I did it this way, because simply returning the Err(Box...) was of type Result<_, Err...>
// and the Ok variant inference wasn't getting along with the prescribed output
